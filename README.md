**Advanced Proof of Stake**
=====================
Receive rewards for securing the BTCA network just by holding coins in your wallet.

Secure the Network and Receive Rewards
-----------------------------------
Running a node on the network will automatically participate in the validation of blocks and transmission of blocks, while your wallet constantly evaluates your personal BTCA transactions to see if you win the right to create the next block.

Secure Network
-----------------------------------
The distributed network of individual nodes provides validation of each transaction and block being added to the blockchain, ensuring the blocks and transactions are valid.

Consistent Block Times
-----------------------------------
The target block spacing is 60 seconds. A vast improvement over traditional Proof of Stake implementations, Time Protocol, introduced in BTCA, reduces the amount of work spent calculating staking hashes, brings more consistency to the network block times, reduces RAM usage and provides a fairer distribution of block rewards.
These improvements lower the barrier of entry for staking, allowing for low-end devices and smaller coin balance to efficiently stake their BTCA.
Less Energy Consumption
Proof of Stake can be done on everyday household computing platforms and does not require any specialized mining equipment or high energy costs to keep the network functioning.

Fair Stake
-----------------------------------
Every UTXO has the chance of winning a stake, with a linear reduction in difficulty based on the value of the UTXO. BTCA does not have any age multiplier in the staking algorithm.

*Frequently asked Questions*
=====================

What is a Proof of Stake?
-----------------------------------
Proof of Stake is an emerging consensus mechanism that needs to be performed in order to create a new group of trustless transactions (the so-called block) on a distributed ledger called blockchain. In the new age of Digital Currencies, there has to be something to back the creation of the coins, and with that comes Proof of Stake. It is the green way of receiving (staking) crypto in comparison to the Proof of Work coins you have probably heard of with Bitcoin or Monero. They use more energy than a small country to power their blockchain. BTCA uses far less energy than Bitcoin or Monero.

What are the advantages of PoS over PoW?
-----------------------------------
Compared to the PoW cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Monero, it is far easier and less costly to participate in the network and receive rewards with BTCA. You can stake even with 1 BTCA, and with BTCA's Cold Staking, you have the opportunity to keep your energy and hardware costs as low as possible.
What is Staking?
Staking is the process of locking your coins for any time period set by you in order to help the network achieve consensus of proof of stake by validating every transaction that occurs on the network to be written permanently to the blockchain. In return stakers that mint the next block are rewarded a block reward.

How does the staking work?
-----------------------------------
Whenever an user has at least 1 BTCA in their fully synchronized BTCA core wallet, that node then is permitted to participate in the network with its corresponding amount of stake. BTCA uses an advanced Proof of Stake algorithm, which effectively secures the network against malicious actors. This allows BTCA owners to receive block rewards just by helping to secure the network. Anyone who owns BTCA can stake and receive rewards.
How can I receive BTCAs as the rewards with Proof of Stake?
It is simple. Buy BTCAs on the exchange, move coins to your wallet, hold, and unlock your wallet for staking. The more coins you hold in your wallet, the more likely you will get a reward.

**Specialized BTCA Masternodes**
=====================
Get more rewards for hosting and providing layer two services to the BTCA network.
BTCA Masternodes provide additional nodes to validate blocks and transactions, adding to the distributed security of the network.

Securing the BTCA Network
-----------------------------------
BTCA Masternodes provide a 2nd layer of security to the network by providing additional nodes to validate blocks and transactions.

Decentralized Governance
-----------------------------------
Without established decision making protocols, progress, development, and growth can grind to a halt.

Block Rewards & Voting Rights
-----------------------------------
Masternode owners are rewarded for their service to the network, with a portion of the block reward being sent to a masternode in a round robin fashion on the creation of each block.

***Frequently asked Questions***
=====================

What is a Masternode?
-----------------------------------
A Masternode is a specially configured wallet that will support the network in more ways than a normal staking wallet. These functions require 1,000 BTCAs to start and therefore the user is rewarded for both supporting the network and locking the collateral.

Why should I run a Masternode?
-----------------------------------
Being a Masternode holder is incentivized by being rewarded more BTCA than stakers through the higher block reward. Masternode reward is equal to 0.9 BTCA, while staking reward is 0.1 BTCA per block.

What does it mean to lock coins as Masternode collateral?
-----------------------------------
Your 1,000 BTCA is still yours to completely control, however should you spend the 1,000 BTCA your masternode will stop and you will no longer earn block rewards. The 1,000 locked BTCAs simply act as collateral and allow you and your masternode server to secure the BTCA network.

What Are The Minimum Hardware Requirements?
-----------------------------------
It is recommended that the machine running the BTCAd wallet has 1Gb RAM, although 512Mb RAM with 1GB swap is fine. The BTCA blockchain is only ~100Mb, but, for future use it is recommended to have at least 1GB free storage space. Additionally, a single core processor is sufficient to run the network.
